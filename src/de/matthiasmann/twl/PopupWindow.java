/**
 * A generic popup window.
 * Must not be added as a child to another Widget.
 *
 * While other widgets have a parent/child relationship, popup windows have
 * only have a owner.
 *
 * When a popup window is open it will block all mouse and keyboard events to
 * the UI layer of it's owner. This includes the owner, all it's children, all
 * siblings and parents etc.
 *
 * If the popup window is hidden or disabled it will close instead.
 * 
 * When the owner is hidden (either directly or indirectly) or removed from
 * the GUI tree then the popup is also closed.
 *
 * To use a PopupWindow construct it with your widget as owner and add the
 * content widget. Call {@code openPopup} to make it visible.
 *
 * Only one widget should be added as child to a popup window. This widget
 * will occupy the whole inner area. If more then one widget is added then
 * they will overlap.
